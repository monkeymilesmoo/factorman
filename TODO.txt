ENTITYIMAGES PROBLEMS:

Somehow fix splitters images. they have different images for updownleftright so maybe run them through the spritesheet manipulator
Also inserter pieces should go into spritesheets
also pipe spritesheet. not sure if im gonna have the fluid in the pipe or not
also pipe covers are a thing
rail images are a nightmare im not touching those for a while
trainstop images are a mess
also trains. basically all train images will be put off for now
all the train wagons also need fixing
vehicles need implementing too
not even gonna try spidertron rn
roboport needs to be animated
circuit connectors and such


Maybe serialize entityimages/properties when everything is entered at the end

Make crafting class or something to handle crafting in inventory

Add a ui for each building type

fix placing from hotbar

somehow make little bit on end of belt

make inventory save

make recipes save

Maybe doWork() in a separate thread, but that seems weird.

Bake player shadow into one image on open

Add player mask for different colors

fix placement ghost size to be the same as normal buildings

Actual terrain generation with noise and such

Probably make rendering more efficient somehow. It currently is a little too slow I think.

fix stacksizes in itemproperties

make placing ghost green or red ghost depending on placability

Selectable working x button

Add map
Maybe add zoom
