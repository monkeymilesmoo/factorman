TODO:

Tile entities
make a tileentity arraylist in chunkgrid that saves every placed tileentity
call every instance on this list every tick to update()

Buildings
Anything always animated is animated on gp.frameNumber.
Maybe make in a separate thread, but that seems weird.

Clicking makes a building or something
Add inventory - at least a hotbar to place Buildings
The little yellow selection thing around tileentities in factorio - its in C:\Program Files\Factorio\data\core\graphics

Actual terrain generation with noise and such

Probably make rendering more efficient somehow. It currently is a little too slow I think.


Add map
Maybe add zoom
