TODO:


Somehow get slot number to coorespond with stupid system of stacking all items in one slot
Maybe make it so each slot gets its own array item? that seems wasteful tho
probably just make it so each item has an array end index which is calculated when updated

Only able to select slot with an item in it

selecting item makes it follow cursor and dissapear from inventory

Add ability to remove from inventory

make a tileentity arraylist in chunkgrid that saves every placed tileentity
call every instance on this list every tick to update()

Bake shadows into images

Maybe make in a separate thread, but that seems weird.

Clicking makes a building or something

Add player mask for different colors

Actual terrain generation with noise and such

Probably make rendering more efficient somehow. It currently is a little too slow I think.


Add map
Maybe add zoom
