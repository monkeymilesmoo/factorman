TODO:

standard UI drawnumber() replaces 1400 with 1.4k for example

hovered slot turns orange
selected slot needs to be a thing

Add ability to remove from inventory

make a tileentity arraylist in chunkgrid that saves every placed tileentity
call every instance on this list every tick to update()

Bake shadows into images

Maybe make in a separate thread, but that seems weird.

Clicking makes a building or something

Add player mask for different colors

Actual terrain generation with noise and such

Probably make rendering more efficient somehow. It currently is a little too slow I think.


Add map
Maybe add zoom
