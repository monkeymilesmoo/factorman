TODO:


fix dragging buildings

make placing ghost green or red ghost depending on placability


make a tileentity arraylist in chunkgrid that saves every placed tileentity
call every instance on this list every tick to update()

Bake shadows into images

Maybe make in a separate thread, but that seems weird.

Add player mask for different colors

Actual terrain generation with noise and such

Probably make rendering more efficient somehow. It currently is a little too slow I think.

Selectable working x button

Add map
Maybe add zoom
