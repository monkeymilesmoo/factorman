TODO:



Implement generateNewChunk();

Tile entities
Buildings
Interact with gp.frameNumber somehow.
Maybe make in a separate thread, but that seems weird.

Add ability to detect mouse location
Clicking makes a building or something
Add inventory - at least a hotbar to place Buildings
The little yellow selection thing around tileentities in factorio - its in C:\Program Files\Factorio\data\core\graphics

Actual terrain generation with noise and such

Probably make rendering more efficient somehow. It currently is a little too slow I think.


Add map
Maybe add zoom
